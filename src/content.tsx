    answer:
      "Some people register for both apps and wear the uniform of another food delivery app. In addition, fewer drivers mean less competition. The best part is that you get a FREE background check when registering to become a Dasher, whereas it costs AU$30 for an Uber Eats background check.",

      "I have a visa, but what the heck are TFN and ABN in this world? How can I get them?",
    answer:
      "TFN stands for Tax File Number, which is unique to you. You can get it online before applying for an Australian Business Number (ABN). When working as a food delivery driver, you are your own boss and work for yourself, so you need an ABN. Feeling overwhelmed? No worries! We've got your back—our team is here and ready to help you. You can contact us via our Facebook page, Food Delivery Referral Program. We’re here to help!",

We will send you a referral link to sign up. You can also contact us through our Facebook page, Food Delivery Referral Program.",
